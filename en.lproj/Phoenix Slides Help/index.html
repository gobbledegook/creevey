<h1>Phoenix Slides Help</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Phoenix Slides is a fast full-screen slideshow
program and image browser. You can also use it to do lossless JPEG
transformations and view EXIF data. It requires Mac OS X 10.9 or later.</p>

<h2><a name="usage"></a>Usage</h2>
<p>Use the directory listing at the top of the window to
navigate to a directory. You can also drag files or folders
into the window or onto the application icon. Start a slideshow
by clicking on the "Slideshow" button, hitting the return key,
or double-clicking an image's thumbnail.
</p>

<h3>Using the directory listing</h3>
<p>In addition to the usual clicking, you can also type in
directory names to jump directly to them.</p>

<p>The first column of the directory listing contains a list of
mounted volumes. This list is updated automatically when disks
are inserted or ejected. The list is also updated if the current
folder is moved, renamed, or deleted. To refresh the listing
for all other file system changes (new files, renaming of
other folders, etc.), click on a folder name and its contents will
be updated.
</p>

<p>Check "Subfolders" to have the program search all
subdirectories for images. When building the list of images,
it will go into subdirectories as it comes across them
(the search is depth-first). This feature can be amusing when looking
into application bundles.</p>

<p>You can drag a folder or a file in that folder into the window
to jump to that directory. If you drag image files,
they will be selected in the thumbnail view. (You can also drag
non-image files to navigate to a directory; this is to be construed
as a feature. :-)</p>

<p>When you choose a folder to browse, the program builds a list of image
files (based on the file extension (like .jpg) and the four-letter
type code (like 'PICT')). Phoenix Slides supports all image types
that Mac OS X supports (i.e., everything NSImage can read).</p>

<h3>Thumbnails</h3>
<p>After getting the list of filenames, the program starts generating
thumbnails of each of the images. Thumbnails are cached in memory
and discarded when you quit the program.</p>

<p>Phoenix Slides displays basic information (name, size, dimensions)
about the currently
selected file(s) in the status bar at the bottom of the window.</p>

<p>You can resize the thumbnails to display anywhere from 40 to 160
pixels wide. (They're stored 160 pixels wide internally.)</p>

<p>For those who care: Phoenix Slides uses the Epeg library for fast
thumbnailing of JPEGs. Non-JPEG files, on the other hand,
will be thumbnailed slowly. =P</p>

<h3>Selecting images</h3>
<p>You can select images to start a slideshow with them,
move them to the trash, reveal them in the Finder, or set
an image as the desktop background. To select an image, click
on it. Shift-click to extend the selection; command-click to
reverse the selection. You can also select images by dragging
around them (in the whitespace).
</p>

<p>Use the arrow keys on the keyboard to change the selection
(this only works when exactly one image is selected, though).</p>

<h3>Dragging images</h3>
Drag images to another program to open them with
that program, or to the Finder to copy the files.

<h3>Reveal in Finder</h3>
<p>The "Reveal in Finder" menu item can be handy for file operations
that are beyond the limits of drag and drop. If one or more files are selected,
Phoenix Slides tells the Finder to show those files. If you have "Subfolders"
checked and your files are from different directories, the specific behavior
will be up to the Finder. If no files are selected, the Phoenix Slides will
simply open the selected folder in the Finder.
</p>

<h2><a name="slides"></a>Slideshows</h2>
<p>Starting a slideshow will do different things depending
on the current selection:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If no items are selected, it starts a slideshow
	with all images starting at the first image.</li>
	<li>If one item is selected, it starts a slideshow
	with all images starting at the selected image.</li>
	<li>If multiple items are selected, it starts a slideshow
	with just the selected images.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can start a slideshow any time after the list of filenames
is compiled (you don't have to wait for all the thumbnails to load).
</p>

<h3>During the slideshow</h3>
<p>You control the slideshow using the keyboard. Hit 'h' or '?' during
the slideshow to see all the commands (reproduced below). If you need
access to the menu, move the mouse to the top of the screen.</p>

<p>Hit one of the number keys (1-9) to auto-advance the slideshow every
1-9 seconds. Hit the space bar to pause/continue auto-advance.
Hit '0' to stop auto-advance. Hitting a
key to go backwards also stops the auto-advance.</p>

<p>By default, images smaller than the screen will be shown at
actual size. To expand them to fill the screen, choose "Scale Up
Smaller Images" from the Slideshow menu (or hit command-E--think
'embiggen').</p>

<p>If you want to zoom in on an image, use +/- (especially convenient
on the numeric keypad). Use '=' to zoom to actual size (100%). You can
get back to the default size (fit to screen) by hitting '*'.
When the image is larger than the screen, you can use the number keys
on the numeric keypad to scroll around (1-9, except 5). Your scroll
wheel will work also, if your mouse has one.</p>

<p>Ordinarily, the slideshow stops when you reach the last slide.
You can enable loop mode through the Slideshow menu. This will cause
the slideshow to wrap around to the first slide after the last one.
Combined with auto-advance, this would cause the slideshow to go on
forever.</p>

<p>You can switch to other programs while the slideshow is running
(using command-tab, for example). It'll keep going merrily along behind
your other windows. Click on the slideshow window to bring it back to
the front.</p>

<h2><a name="jpeg"></a>JPEG Transformations</h2>
<p>Phoenix Slides can do lossless transformations on JPEG files.
In fact, it uses code from jpegtran (including the EXIF patch),
and supports most of its advanced options, which are briefly
explained below:
</p>

<p><strong>Drop Nontransformable Edge Blocks</strong> - Lossless rotation
is only perfect for images whose size is a multiple of the iMCU block
size, usually 8 or 16. The "imperfect" blocks on the edge can be
trimmed, if desired, though of course this is an irreversible operation.
Here's more from the jpegtran docs:</p>

<pre>jpegtran's default behavior when transforming an odd-size image is designed
to preserve exact reversibility and mathematical consistency of the
transformation set.... Transpose is able to flip the entire image
area.  Horizontal mirroring leaves any partial iMCU column at the right edge
untouched, but is able to flip all rows of the image.  Similarly, vertical
mirroring leaves any partial iMCU row at the bottom edge untouched, but is
able to flip all columns.  The other transforms can be built up as sequences
of transpose and flip operations; for consistency, their actions on edge
pixels are defined to be the same as the end result of the corresponding
transpose-and-flip sequence.
</pre>

<p><strong>Make Progressive</strong> - Creates images suitable for
incremental display over slow communication links. Progressive JPEG files
consist of a series of scans of increasing quality.</p>

<p><strong>Optimize Huffman Table</strong> - Slower, but
creates slightly smaller files.</p>

<p><strong>Grayscale</strong> - Simply removes the color (chrominance)
information, leaving grayscale (luminance) data intact.</p>

<p><strong>JPEG Markers</strong> - Various options to remove JPEG comments
and other data (such as EXIF information) stored in the header of JPEG files.</p>

<p>Phoenix Slides will warn you if you attempt a nonreversible operation.</p>

<h2><a name="cats"></a>Groups/Categories</h2>

<p>Phoenix Slides provides a method to temporarily group or categorize
images. During a slideshow, hit one of the F2-F12 keys to assign an image
to a group. Then, in the thumbnail view, hit F2-F12 to see images in
the corresponding group. You can also hit command-F2(through F12) to toggle
an image's group assignment in both slideshow and thumbnail views.
To clear all category assignments, hit F1 during a slideshow, or command-F1
when viewing thumbnails. Assigning images to groups can be useful for batch
operations, e.g., selecting a bunch of images to perform a JPEG rotation on.</p>

<p>Naturally, you will not be able to use those function keys which
the system or third party utilities have reserved for other things,
the F9-F12 defaults for Expos&eacute; and Dashboard being the most
notable examples. However, you can usually work around this by
holding down either the control or option key when pressing F1-F12.</p>

<p>Categories are temporary and will be lost when Phoenix Slides quits.
You should think of this functionality as a sort of fancy selection mechanism.</p>



<h2><a name="story"></a>The Phoenix Slides story</h2>
<p>One day, Jim (the professor in charge at the research project I work at)
brought in some CDs of photos from Thailand. Let's look at these pictures,
he said. We searched the Macs in the office for suitable slideshow programs,
but to no avail. We ended up using the full-screen mode in Preview. It
was... painful. We couldn't even rotate the images in full-screen mode.
So I decided to write my own.</p>

<p>Remember Curator, the now-abandoned image organizer program by
Caffeine Software? It's nice, but (1) it's dead, (2) the directory
listing acts funny, and (3) you have to wait for a thumbnail to be generated
before you can view an image in a slideshow (WHY?!). I wanted my program
to rectify these problems, so Phoenix Slides is
inspired in part by Curator.</p>

<p>Why Phoenix? Aside from its mythological significance, the phoenix
is also featured prominently on the San Francisco city flag (that's where
we're based). Plus, I'm a fan of Fawkes (Dumbledore's phoenix in the
Harry Potter books).</p>
